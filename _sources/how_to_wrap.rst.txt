Wrapping nodes
**************

Neuropycon is based on Nipype, and is open to any contribution with the wrapping mechanism allowing anyon to contribute.

We provide a tutorial on how to wrap a python package of your choice, based on the explanation provided on the `nipype website <https://nipype.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devel/python_interface_devel.html>`_.

We provide here an example with the `BCT toolbox <https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/>`_, a package largely used in the neuroscience community for computating graph-theoretical based metrics. BCT was orinally a Matlab set of fuctions, but a python version called `bctpy <https://pypi.org/project/bctpy/>`_ also exists.

Here we provide an example of a wrap on one single fuction, incorporated in a `new pipeline <https://neuropycon.github.io/graphpype/auto_examples/plot_inv_ts_to_bct_graph.html#inv-ts-to-bct-graph>`_
in order check how long it took to wrap one function. By itself, the wrapping of a single function (Kcore computation of the BCT, one of the measures available in BCT and not in Radatools) took less than half an hour. The incorporation in a functional pipeline (after the matrix computation and thresholding) took another hour. And adding it to the documentation, and the extension of the visualisation for this purpose took another half day (~4 hour). A rough estimate of the wrap of the K-core function of bctpy package leads to a count of ~50 lines of code (see interfaces/bct/bct.py on github graphype project).

The source code of the corresponding wrapped node can be found `here <https://github.com/neuropycon/graphpype/blob/master/graphpype/interfaces/bct/bct.py>`_
